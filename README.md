# gfx-editor
Created Fall 2019 for CSC 143 with Vince Offenback at North Seattle College. A simple graphics editor with color/transparency control, some custom shapes, and differing brush functionalities. Though much simpler, somewhat reminiscent of [Kid Pix](https://kidpix.app/). Demonstrates OOP, polymorphism, and MVC.

It has been a while since I looked at this! The [.jar file](https://github.com/j-henshaw/gfx-editor/raw/main/GraphicsEditorApp.jar) can be downloaded and run independently. Some examples of previous works are in the Exports folder. Export to .png supports transparency. New shapes could likely be added fairly easily.
